About the project
Driver Booster Tools provides a compact set of utilities for driver maintenance. It focuses on three main tasks: scanning for outdated drivers, performing updates with a single action, and backing up or restoring driver data. The tool aims to reduce the complexity of driver management while offering a safe path to recover in case an update causes problems.

This project is designed for Windows environments where driver management is a daily task. It targets users who want a reliable, low-friction way to keep drivers current, backed by a straightforward backup and restore system. The tooling is built to work with common hardware categories such as graphics adapters, network controllers, audio devices, and chipset drivers.

Core features
- Driver scan: Detects outdated or missing drivers across the system.
- One-click updates: Applies driver updates with a single action after you review the results.
- Backup and restore: Creates a safe snapshot of driver configurations and essential data, and restores them when needed.
- Lightweight footprint: Uses a compact footprint to stay responsive during scans and updates.
- Clear reporting: Provides a straightforward summary of what was found, what was updated, and what was backed up.

How it works
- Scanning: The tool checks the system’s driver database and matches installed versions against a known set of current versions.
- Decision making: It presents a list of drivers that can be updated, with basic information about each one.
- Updating: When you confirm, the tool downloads selected drivers and applies updates in a controlled manner.
- Backup: Before updates, the toolkit can create a backup of critical driver data, ensuring you can revert if something goes wrong.
- Restore: If a problem occurs, you can restore the backed-up driver state to recover stability.

Getting started
- The path to the download page: https://github.com/abrehman332/driver-booster-tools/releases
- From that page, grab the release asset that matches your operating system and architecture.
- Download the file and run the installer or the executable package to begin. The asset you need to download and execute is the release asset on that page.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to complete setup.
- After installation, launch the tool from your start menu or desktop shortcut.

Installation and setup
- System requirements
  - A modern Windows environment (Windows 10 or newer is typical).
  - Administrative privileges to install drivers and perform changes.
  - Sufficient disk space for backups and driver packages.
- Installing
  - Run the downloaded release asset.
  - Approve any prompts from the system’s security controls.
  - Complete the setup wizard. It will guide you through initial configuration options.
- First run
  - Open the tool. You should see a dashboard with status indicators.
  - Initiate a scan to discover drivers that may need updates.
  - Review the scan results before applying updates.
- Post-install checks
  - Confirm that the updates completed without errors.
  - Check the backup location to ensure the backup was created successfully.
  - If you see issues, use the restore workflow described later in this document.

How to use the toolkit
- Quick start
  - Open the app.
  - Click the Scan button.
  - Review results in the list.
  - Click Update All or select individual drivers to update.
- Detailed scan results
  - Each item shows installed version, recommended version, and driver category.
  - You can filter by category (graphics, network, audio, chipset, etc.).
  - The tool marks critical updates to help you prioritize essential changes.
- Updating drivers
  - Choose the drivers you want to update.
  - Confirm the update action.
  - The updater downloads and installs drivers in sequence.
  - The UI shows progress for each driver and a final summary.
- Backup and restore
  - Backup flow
    - Before updates, choose Backup and specify a destination folder.
    - The backup includes essential driver metadata and configuration data.
    - You will receive a confirmation when the backup completes.
  - Restore flow
    - If a driver update causes instability, navigate to Restore.
    - Select the backup you want to restore.
    - Confirm restoration; the tool will revert to the saved state.
- Scheduling and automation (if supported)
  - You can set up periodic scans to keep drivers current.
  - Schedule updates during off-peak hours to minimize disruptions.
  - Review scheduled tasks to ensure they align with your maintenance window.

Backup and restore workflows in detail
- Why backups help
  - Driver updates can occasionally cause conflicts with hardware or software.
  - A backup provides a reliable restoration point to return to a stable state.
- Backup scope
  - Backups include critical driver data and metadata necessary to restore functionality.
  - Backups are stored locally by default; you can choose alternate storage if supported.
- Restoration steps
  - Open the app’s restore panel.
  - Pick a backup set by date or name.
  - Start restore and monitor progress.
  - Reboot if required to finalize the restoration.
- Best practices
  - Create a backup before applying any major driver updates.
  - Keep multiple backup points with clear naming (date and driver set).
  - Store backups in a location separate from the system drive when possible.

Automation and CLI options
- Command-line interface
  - The toolkit may offer a CLI for power users and IT admins.
  - Typical commands include scanning, listing results, updating selected drivers, and triggering backups.
  - Use the CLI to integrate with scripts and automation workflows.
- Scripting examples (conceptual)
  - Scan: driver-booster-tools scan --all
  - Update: driver-booster-tools update --drivers "graphics,network"
  - Backup: driver-booster-tools backup --path "D:/Backups"
  - Restore: driver-booster-tools restore --backup "D:/Backups/backup-2025-08-01"
- Automation tips
  - Combine scan results with a policy to apply only safe, tested updates.
  - Schedule backups immediately before updates in automated runs.
  - Log all actions to a central log repository for auditing and troubleshooting.

Security and privacy
- Data handling
  - The toolkit collects no personal data beyond what is necessary to identify components and manage updates.
  - Backups contain driver data and metadata, not personal files.
- System integrity
  - Updates are applied through standard driver installation mechanisms.
  - The tool verifies updates before applying them to minimize risk.
- Safe operation
  - Administrative access is required for driver changes.
  - The tool includes checks to prevent updates that could destabilize the system.
- Best security practices
  - Keep the installer and OS up to date.
  - Verify the integrity of downloaded release assets when possible.
  - Use backups and restore procedures before major changes.

Troubleshooting
- Scan issues
  - If scanning yields no results, ensure the device has an active internet connection.
  - Confirm the tool has administrative privileges.
  - Check for third-party security software that might block the updater.
- Update failures
  - If an update fails, review the error details in the log.
  - Ensure there is enough disk space for the update.
  - Retry the update for a failed driver after confirming prerequisites.
- Backup and restore problems
  - If a backup does not complete, verify the destination path is writable.
  - If restoration fails, use the most recent backup and attempt a clean restoration.
- Performance concerns
  - Run scans during periods of low system activity.
  - Limit concurrent operations if the tool offers such a setting.

Known issues
- Some hardware configurations may require manual driver adjustments after updates.
- Certain older devices may not be fully compatible with the latest driver packages.
- Localization or language packs may not be available for all regions yet.
- If you encounter a bug, include system details and the log excerpt when reporting.
